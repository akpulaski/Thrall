    "In this perilous border city separating the mundane from the magical, I staked my career as a human reporter navigating the seedy underbelly of a world dominated by near immortal monsters."

    e "(His voice is like a caress, as his fangs graze my neck, palm resting where a beating heart once hammered against my ghostly chest.)"

    z "It's wonderful, alright. Together, we will be unstoppable. Not a single soul won't kneel before us in this world or the next, Estrella."
    e "(Slowly, memories flood my entire being, evoking nostalgia for a life I once lived yet had forgotten, locked away inside of my head, just like they key to my tomb was buried within my soul.)"
    e "(Our tainted love, I thought doomed from the start, blossomed into an empire born in darkness. I walked a tightrope between a twisted vamp and a ravenous werewolf, straying from the path of righteousness.)"
    e "(Before I decided the corrupt bastards I reported on would serve {b}{i}me{i}{b}. My men cashed in on my revenge, so I no longer had to choose between them.)"

    l "It will be glorious! No more tip-toeing around playing the part of the good little noir cop. Embrace yourself as we have done."
    e "(All six of my senses are heightened as my body rejects the void.)"
    e "Zane...? Lazarus...?"
    e "(My voice is but a whisper as consuming passion ignites my spirit, evil and lust coursing through me as I reclaim first my body, and then my throne.)"
    e "(Nothing good ever came from being enthralled by the supernatural...)"
    e "(But having two {b}{i}thralls{i}{b} at my beck and call is priceless. The greatest gift that could ever been given.)"

    z "All we wanted was for our sweet, corrupted pup to return to her pack."
    z "Now look at her, choosing to die yet again rather than accept herself as the bitch she is."
    l "It was glorious, wasn't it? When she dropped the little noir cop act and embraced herself as a mistress of the night?"
    l "Regardless, I told you to make her stop. That routine of hers drove her crazy. Now it's too late. I'm starting to suspect she's bound to this cruel fate."

    l "You're right. What's another fifty or hundred years, give or take, to see the Queen of Darkness in all her glory once again? To have a shot at the treasures she's taken to the grave?"
    z "Nothing, dear friend. It costs us nothing to wait. Estrella is a priceless gem."
    l "Yes. Worth more than the most ancient blood or purest of gold. Even in her most grotesque form."
    e "Zane... Lazarus..."
    e "(My voice is but a whisper as the last bit of my being gives out.)"
    e "Help... me!"
    l "No can do. Last time you tried to slit my throat for trying to tame you. We'll see you soon, sweetheart. Rest easy now."
